# This is a script for Debian packagers,
# to generate man files from executables' --help options,
# using help2man.
# Tested on Dash, should work with other POSIX shells.

# Put this script in the package source debian/ directory
# (or some other location, to taste),
# add a file debian/genman-list, debian/<packagename>.genman-list
# or debian/<packagename>.<section-number>.genman-list
# with a list of the executables whose manpages are to be built.
# Shell globs may be used.
# If set, <section-number> determines the manual section,
# otherwise section 1 is used by default.
# Multiple genman-list files can be used, for source building
# multiple packages, or for different manual sections.
#
# Built manpages will be put in debian/genman-pages/, and
# their paths will be appended to an existing debian/*manpages file,
# or put in a new manpages or <packagename>.manpages file.
#
# genman.sh --clean will return everything to its previous state.
#
# Run the script manually before building the package,
# or to auto-run, add this to debian/rules:
# (adjust the path to genman.sh if necessary)

HELP="    genman.sh: generate man pages from executables \"--help\" options
Options:
    --clean     Return everything in the package debian/ directory
                to the state it was in before running the script.
    -h --help   Show this message.

This is a wrapper script around help2man for debian packagers,
which automates the generation of simple man pages
from the output of executables' \"--help\" option,
along with information from dpkg,
and configuration files in the package source debian/ directory.

CONFIGURATION:

 The script will look for files in debian/:
 <packagename>.<section>.genman-list
 <packagename>.genman-list
 genman-list
 If <section> ([1-8]) is missing, assume 1.
 If <packagename> is also missing, get from dpkg.
 The file should have a list of the executables
 (paths relative to the package root) whose manpages are to be built.
 Shell globs may be used.
 Multiple genman-list files can be used, for source building
 multiple packages, or for different manual sections.

Built manpages will be put in debian/genman-pages/, and
their paths will be appended to an existing debian/*manpages file,
or put in a new manpages or <packagename>.manpages file.

The script can be located anywhere, but should be run
from the package source root directory.
Run it manually before building the package,
or to auto-run, add this to debian/rules:
(adjust the path to genman.sh if necessary)

override_dh_installman:
	debian/genman.sh
	dh_installman

override_dh_clean:
	dh_clean
	debian/genman.sh --clean

Also add help2man to Build-Depends in debian/control.
