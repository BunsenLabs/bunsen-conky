=====

bunsenweather.sh: universal script - simple - uses ISP
Displays simple weather information on the desktop.
It needs an API Key from http://openweathermap.org/api

=====

bl-conky-manager and bl-conky-session are installed by bunsen-utilities.

bl-conky-manager saves the running conkys to a default saved-session file.
Different saved-session files can specified with:

    bl-conky-manager -f /path/to/session-file

(See 'man bl-conky-manager' for more information.)

The default saved-session can be run with bl-conky-session, or different
saved-session files with

    bl-conky-session /path/to/file1 /path/to/file2 etc

(See 'man bl-conky-session for more information.)
